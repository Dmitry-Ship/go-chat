# Project Memory Index

This folder contains agent learnings organized by category.
Categories are created automatically as agents work on features.

## How This Works

1. After each successful feature, learnings are extracted and categorized
2. Relevant memory files are loaded into agent context for future features
3. Usage statistics help prioritize which memories are most helpful

## Categories

- **gotchas.md** - Mistakes and edge cases to avoid
- Other categories are created automatically based on feature work
